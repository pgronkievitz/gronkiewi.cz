* About me
Hi, my name's Patryk. I'm Data Engineering and Analysis student at Rzesz√≥w University of Technology (Politechnika Rzeszowska, Poland). I'm one of the co-founders of [[http://knml.prz.edu.pl][Machine Learning Student Association]] (also known as KNML) at my university.

I've created blog recently, so I'd be glad if you'd check it out ([[https://gronkiewicz.dev][link]]).
* Projects
All of my projects are available on my [[https://github.com/pgronkievitz][Github profile]]. My favorites are:

** Coronavirus analysis
We've started bunch of internal hackathons during the pandemic, but this was the first one and probably that's my favorite one. It's available at [[https://github.com/knmlprz][KNML GitHub Organization]].
** Autojupy
Autojupy is not maintained anymore, but it did a great job during my classes. I had to generate some charts with lots of points - with autojupy I could send my notebooks to the remote server and sleep calmly waiting for the notification that everything's done.
* Contact
You can contact me on my email [[mailto:patryk@gronkiewi.cz][patryküêígronkiewi.cz]]. I'm also available on [[https://t.me/pgronkievitz][Telegram]].
